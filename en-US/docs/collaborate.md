# How do I share a Citasion project with my collaborators?  

You can share a Citasion project with your collaborators working on the same paper easily.  

To do that, you need to login your account. On the home dashboard or inside the view of a project, you can click the <b>Share</b> button and type the emails of your collaborators. You can enter more than one email address, and separate them by clicking the 'Enter' key on the keyboard. After all emails are entered, don't forget to click the Share button.  

Your collaborators will be notified via email.

# What do I exactly share with my collaborators when I share a Citasion project with them?  

When you share a Citasion project with your collaborators, they will be able to access and manage references in the shared project, and cite the added references from this project when they write the same or a different academic paper.  

Any changes, such as adding new references or reference updates in the shared project are synchronized on a real-time basis and will be visible to all users of that project.

Your collaborators and you will be able to use Citasion to insert citations and style references in the same Google Docs. This also applies to Word and Overleaf.
