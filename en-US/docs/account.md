## I can't log into my BibNext account using Google/Microsoft in the Word environment. What should I do?   

The authentication is not stable in the Word environment. We have received multiple reports from users that authentication using Google/Microsoft may fail in the Word environment. If that happens to you, you can enable password login for your account, and log into your BibNext account using email/password in the Word environment.   

To enable password login for your account, you can refer to the answer of the next question.
