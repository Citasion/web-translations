You can import papers from all major research aggregators (e.g., Google Scholar), and manage the imported references together with your collaborators. With the help of our browser extensions and add-ons, you can write collaboratively and easily cite the imported papers in Google Docs, Word, and Overleaf. There are over 1,000 reference styles that you can choose from.\n\n To start Citasion, you will need to create [a Citasion account](/register) and install Citasion browser extension.
