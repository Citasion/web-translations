You can import papers from all major research aggregators (e.g., Google Scholar), and manage the imported references together with your collaborators. With the help of our browser extensions and add-ons, you can write collaboratively and easily cite the imported papers in Google Docs, Word, and Overleaf. There are over 1,000 reference styles that you can choose from.\n\n To start BibNext, you will need to create [a BibNext account](/register) and install BibNext browser extension. BibNext supports a variety of browsers, such as: \n\n - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/BibNext/oklpcimghhhhanifldcdlfgoaigfiolj) ![Chrome ><](/static/images/docs/chrome-tiny.png)\n\n - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/BibNext/) ![Firefox ><](/static/images/docs/firefox-tiny.png)\n\n - [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/BibNext/kgcdgjmildkboglkjlmllmkchhibgbcc) ![Edge ><](/static/images/docs/edge-tiny.png)\n\n If you write papers in Word, you will also need to install our [Word Add-in](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200003530?tab=Overview) ![Word](/static/images/docs/word-tiny.png).\n\n Paper importation is typically the first step for reference management.

        "title": "BibNext: Manage Papers on BibNext",
        "content": "## Overview\n\n This section covers:\n\n * [What is the difference between Project view and Reference view?](#diff)\n\n * [Can I use the references that I added to the Reference view in my writing?](#use-references)\n\n * [How do I add references from Reference view to individual projects?](#add-references)\n\n * [How do I manage references in a project?](#manage-references-in-projects)\n\n * [How do I manage all references?](#manage-references-all)\n\n <a name='diff'></a>\n\n ## What is the difference between Project view and Reference view?\n\n The homepage that you see whenever you log into BibNext Web App is the Project view. You can also access the Project view by clicking **Projects** on the left navigation menu on your dashboard. The Project view organizes your references into different projects. You can manage references in each individual project on this view.\n\n You can access the Reference view by clicking **References** on the left navigation menu on your dashboard. The Reference view allows you to access and modify all references across different projects.\n\n The biggest difference between the two views lies in:\n\n * adding a reference\n\n * deleting a reference\n\n ### Adding a reference\n\n When you add a new reference to an individual project, that reference can be accessed from both the Reference view and from that individual project. When you associate that project with a writing document (e.g., Google Docs, Word, and Overleaf), you can cite that reference from the writing document immediately.\n\n **In contrast**, when you add a new reference via the Reference view, that reference can only be accessed via the Reference view and is not associated with any projects. In other words, **you won't be able to directly use a reference that is added to the Reference view. You need to perform an extra step by adding that reference to the project that is associated with your writing document** (e.g., Google Docs, Word, and Overleaf).\n\n ### Deleting a reference\n\n When you delete a reference from an individual project, that reference is only unlinked from that project but the reference itself is not deleted. That reference can still be found in the Reference view.\n\n <p> <img alt='Project View' src='/static/images/docs/delete-reference-in-projects.png' width='500' /> </p>\n\n **In contrast**, when you delete a reference in the Reference view, that reference will be firstly unlinked from all projects it is associated with, then completely removed from the Reference view.\n\n <p> <img alt='Project View' src='/static/images/docs/delete-reference.png' width='500' /> </p>\n\n <a name='use-references'></a>\n\n ## Can I use the references that I added to the Reference view in my writing?\n\n If you add one or more references to the Reference view, you can not use these references immediately in your writing, because writing documents (e.g., Google Docs, Word, and Overleaf) can only pull references that are in a project whereas these references are not in any projects yet.\n\n You need to add these references to the target project (i.e., the project that is associated with your writing document) first before you can cite any of them.\n\n <a name='add-references'></a>\n\n ## How do I add references from **Reference** view to individual projects?\n\n To add any references to a project in the Reference view, you need to:\n\n 1. check all the references you want to add by clicking the checkbox on the top left corner of each reference\n\n 2. select the target project in the right sidebar\n\n 3. click <strong>Confirm</strong>\n\n <p> <img alt='Project View' src='/static/images/docs/add-reference-to-projects.png' width='700' /> </p>\n\n You can select a list of multiple references by selecting only the first and last references while pressing **Ctrl** or **Command** or **Shift** button.\n\n <a name='manage-references-in-projects'></a>\n\n ## How do I manage references in a project?\n\n <p> <a href='/home'> <img alt='Project View' src='/static/images/docs/projectView.png' /> </a> </p>\n\n <p> In each BibNext project that you create or is shared with you by collaborators, you can: </p>\n\n - search for references added to this project\n\n - add new references\n\n - delete references\n\n - update references\n\n ### Add new references manually\n\n There are a variety of approaches to add references into a project, including:\n\n - import data from other programs\n\n - parse PDF papers\n\n - upload PDF papers\n\n - copy and Paste your BibTeX entries\n\n - one-click paper importation\n\n - add a reference manually\n\n For the first five approaches, please refer to <a href='/docs/docs/import-manage-papers'>/docs/import-manage-papers</a>.\n\n To add a reference manually:\n\n 1. open your project on the web application\n\n 2. click **Add References**\n\n 3. click **Add A Reference Manually**\n\n 4. input reference information\n\n New references added into a project can be immediately cited and used in any associated writing documents (e.g., Google Docs, Word, and Overleaf).\n\n ### Update a reference\n\n To update a reference:\n\n 1. open your project on the web application\n\n 2. click <img src='/static/images/support/dot-button.png' alt='dot' /> button in the right top corner of the reference entry you want to update\n\n 3. click Update button\n\n 4. update the reference information\n\n ### Delete a reference\n\n To delete a reference from a project:\n\n 1. open your project on the web application\n\n 2. click <img src='/static/images/support/dot-button.png' alt='dot' /> button in the right top corner of the reference entry you want to update\n\n 3. click Delete button\n\n <a name='manage-references-all'></a>\n\n ## How do I manage all references?\n\n <p> <a href='/references'> <img alt='Reference View' src='/static/images/docs/referenceView.png' /> </a> </p>\n\n In the Reference view, you can:\n\n - search for references\n\n - add new references\n\n - delete references\n\n - update references\n\n - add existing references to a project\n\n ### Add new references manually\n\n There are a variety of approaches to add references into a project, including:\n\n - import data from other programs\n\n - parse PDF papers\n\n - upload PDF papers\n\n - copy and Paste your BibTeX entries\n\n - one-click paper importation\n\n - add a reference manually\n\n For the first five approaches, please refer to <a href='/docs/docs/import-manage-papers'>/docs/import-manage-papers</a>.

For more information, please see the following two sections:\n\n * [Can I use the references that I added to the Reference view in my writing?](#use-references)\n\n * [How do I add references from **Reference** view to individual projects?](#add-references)\n\n ### Update a reference\n\n To update a reference in the Reference view:\n\n 2. click <img src='/static/images/support/dot-button.png' alt='dot' /> button in the right top corner of the reference entry you want to update\n\n 3. click Update button\n\n 4. update the reference information\n\n Please note that the updates to a reference will be reflected everywhere if the reference is in multiple projects.\n\n ### Delete a reference\n\n To delete a reference from a project:\n\n 2. click <img src='/static/images/support/dot-button.png' alt='dot' /> button in the right top corner of the reference entry you want to delete\n\n 3. click Delete button\n\n Please note that deleting a reference via the Reference view also means deleting the reference from every project.\n\n ### Add references to a project\n\n Please see [**How do I add references from **Reference** view to individual projects?**](#add-references)"
