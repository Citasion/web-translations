## I can not log into my Citasion account using Google/Microsoft in the Word environment. What should I do?   

The authentication is not stable in the Word environment. We have received multiple reports from users that authentication using Google/Microsoft may fail in the Word environment. If that happens to you, you can enable password login for your account, and log into your Citasion account using email/password in the Word environment.  

To enable password login for your account, you can refer to the answer of the next question.  

## I have already created an account using Google/Microsoft. Can I log into the same account using email and password?

* navigate to and log into Citasion via your regular browser  

* click 'Account' on the left navigation bar   

* on the Account page, click 'ENABLE PASSWORD LOGIN'
